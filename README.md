This is a basic boiler plate repository, containing scripts intended for game development in C Sharp, using UnityEngine. Scripts will be added as I learn to write them, along with a description here in the readme.

# ColorChanger
- Allows the user to change the color of the object that the script is attached to.

# Movescript
- This is the beginnings of a basic move script, allowing the user to move a game object using input keys.

# ClickToMoveScript
- Allows the player to move their character based on where they click on the map. Assuming the area clicked is "walkable allowed", the object will move to the designated area.
- It also allows the user to interact with the objects in a game world. if a game object with an interaction script is clicked, the moving object will interact with it. (if the player clicks an NPC, Treasure Chest, etc.)
